## 🧠 What I Build

🚨 From system-level experiments to pixel-perfect Flutter apps — I design things that *perform*.  
Here’s my creative arsenal:

| 🔧 Tech Stack            | 🚀 Expertise Area                       |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Flutter + Firebase**   | 🧼 App architecture & cloud sync       |
| **Supabase Storage**     | 📦 File hosting & permissions         |
| **Clean Architecture**   | 🧠 Scalable code & modular layers     |
| **CI/CD Pipelines**      | 🤖 GitHub Actions for fast shipping   |
| **Firestore + Security** | 🔐 Real-time data with smart rules    |
| **Dart / C# / SQL**      | ⚙️ Logic-heavy backends               |
